</div>

## Features

This monorepo contains two packages built with TypeScript and Zod:

**@stackone/mcp-connectors** - Pre-built connectors for popular SaaS tools

- 35+ production-ready MCP connectors
- Typesafe wrapper around MCP capabilities
- Local development with auto-reload
- No dependencies on server runtime or transport
- Runs on Bun, Node, and Cloudflare Workers

**@stackone/mcp-config-types** - Shared configuration types

- Zod schemas for connector credentials and setup fields

- Designed for AI coding agents (Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- Enables type-safe connector development

## Usage

### For End Users

The MCP connectors in this repo power [**disco.dev**](https://disco.dev) - the easiest way to connect your favourite tools to your favourite AI applications using the Model Context Protocol.

Go to [disco.dev](https://disco.dev) to get started with zero setup.

### For Developers

Use these packages to build your own MCP servers:

```bash
npm install @stackone/mcp-connectors @stackone/mcp-config-types
```

The connectors can be imported and used in your own MCP server implementations, and the config types provide TypeScript definitions for all connector configurations.

## Development

This is a monorepo managed with Bun and Turbo.

### Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### Start a server from a connector

No credentials needed:

```bash
bun start --connector test
```

Production connectors with credentials:

```bash
bun start --connector asana --credentials '{"apiKey":"your-api-key"}'
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`

## Inspiration

> "Everything is just fetch wrapped in a function, delivered in pure typescript."

The typing in this package is heavily inspired by the [AI SDK by Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/ai) and the development process has been influenced by the work of Sam at [Alchemy](https://alchemy.run).
