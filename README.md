## Features

The @stackone/mcp-connectors package is built with TypeScript and Zod.

It is designed to be easily generated by AI coding agents such as Claude Code, OpenCode and Cursor CLI.

- typesafe wrapper around mcp capabilities
- schemas for credentials and setup fields
- local development with auto-reload
- no dependencies on the server runtime or the transport
- runs on bun, node and cloudflare workers

## Usage

These MCP connectors are loaded into [**disco.dev**](https://disco.dev) - the easiest way to connect your favourite tools to your favourite AI applications using the Model Context Protocol.

Go to [disco.dev](https://disco.dev) to get started.

## Inspiration

> "Everything is just fetch wrapped in a function, delivered in pure typescript."

The typing in this package is heavily inspired by the [AI SDK by Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/ai) and the development process has been influenced by the work of Sam at [Alchemy](https://alchemy.run).
